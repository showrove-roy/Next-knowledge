              Cross-Origin Resource Sharing CORS is an HTTP-based security
              mechanism controlled and enforced by the client web browser. It
              allows a service API to indicate any origin other than its own
              from which the client can request resources. It has been designed
              in response to the same-origin policy SOP that restricts how a
              website HTML document or JS script loaded by one origin can
              interact with a resource from another origin. CORS is used to
              explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting
              others.

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?

              Firebase can be seen as a server-less backend for mobile apps, web
              apps, etc. It is a service provided by Google. It has many
              features like Realtime database, Cloud functions, Analytics,
              Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore, etc. Firebase is, essentially, a
              key-value store that can use to quickly prototype and run a simple
              application, either native mobile or in-browser javascript.

              The react private route component renders child components (
              children ) if the user is logged in. If not logged in the user is
              redirected to the /login page with the return url passed in the
              location state property.

              Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's
              JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl
              in 2009. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime
              environment for developing server-side and networking
              applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment which is based on
              Googleâ€™s V8 Engine i.e. with the help of Node.js we can run the
              JavaScript outside of the browser. Other things that you may or
              may not have read about Node.js is that it is single-threaded,
              based on event-driven architecture, and non-blocking based on the
              I/O model.
